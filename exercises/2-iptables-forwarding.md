## üß™ Understanding the FORWARD Chain

The FORWARD chain processes packets that:
- Enter the firewall on one interface
- Are destined for a different network
- Need to be routed through the firewall

### Current State Check

```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Check current iptables rules
sudo iptables -L -v -n

# Check FORWARD chain specifically
sudo iptables -L FORWARD -v -n
```

You should see the default ACCEPT policy we set during provisioning.

## üîß Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Ensure Packet Forwarding is enabled


```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Enable IP forwarding (should already be enabled)
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p

# Check forwarding is enabled
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# Should return: 1
```

### Step 2: Monitor FORWARD Chain Activity

Open two terminals to the firewall to monitor traffic:

**Terminal 1 (Monitoring):**
```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Watch packet counters in real-time
watch -n 1 'sudo iptables -L FORWARD -v -n'
```

**Terminal 2 (Testing):**
```bash
# Generate some traffic
vagrant ssh internal-client
ping -c 5 dmz-server
```

Observe how packet counters increase in Terminal 1.

### Step 3: Create Restrictive FORWARD Rules

Now let's start controlling traffic between networks:

```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# First, let's change the default policy to DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# Test connectivity now - it should fail!
```

Test from another terminal:
```bash
vagrant ssh internal-client
ping -c 3 dmz-server  # This should now fail!
```

### Step 4: Selectively Allow Traffic

Let's create specific rules to control inter-network communication:

#### Allow Internal LAN to DMZ (HTTP only):
```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Allow HTTP from Internal to DMZ
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d 192.168.100.0/24 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# Allow return traffic (established connections)
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.100.0/24 -d 192.168.200.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

Test HTTP access:
```bash
vagrant ssh internal-client

# This should work now
curl http://dmz-server

# But ping should still fail
ping -c 3 dmz-server
```

#### Allow ICMP (ping) between Internal and DMZ:
```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Allow ICMP from Internal to DMZ
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d 192.168.100.0/24 -p icmp -j ACCEPT

# Allow ICMP responses back
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.100.0/24 -d 192.168.200.0/24 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
```

Test again:
```bash
vagrant ssh internal-client
ping -c 3 dmz-server  # Should work now
```

### Step 5: Block DMZ to Internal Communication

Let's prevent DMZ servers from accessing internal networks:

```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Explicitly deny DMZ to Internal (already blocked by default DROP, but let's be explicit)
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.100.0/24 -d 192.168.200.0/24 -j DROP
```

Test this restriction:
```bash
vagrant ssh dmz-server

# This should fail (except for established connections from previous internal->dmz traffic)
ping -c 3 internal-client
```

## üìä Traffic Flow Scenarios

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IC as Internal Client
    participant FW as Firewall FORWARD Chain
    participant DS as DMZ Server

    Note over IC,DS: Scenario 1: HTTP Request (ALLOWED)
    IC->>FW: TCP SYN to dmz-server:80
    Note over FW: Rule: ACCEPT -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d 192.168.100.0/24 -p tcp --dport 80
    FW->>DS: Forward TCP SYN
    DS->>FW: TCP SYN-ACK response
    Note over FW: Rule: ACCEPT --ctstate ESTABLISHED
    FW->>IC: Forward TCP SYN-ACK

    Note over IC,DS: Scenario 2: SSH Request (BLOCKED)
    IC->>FW: TCP SYN to dmz-server:22
    Note over FW: No matching ACCEPT rule, default DROP
    FW->>FW: Packet dropped

    Note over IC,DS: Scenario 3: DMZ to Internal (BLOCKED)
    DS->>FW: Any packet to internal-client
    Note over FW: Explicit DROP rule
    FW->>FW: Packet dropped
```

## üîç Advanced FORWARD Chain Rules

### Rule Ordering Matters!

```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Check current rule order
sudo iptables -L FORWARD -v -n --line-numbers

# Rules are processed top to bottom - first match wins
# More specific rules should come before general rules
```

### Logging Blocked Traffic

Add logging to see what's being blocked:

```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Add logging rule before the final DROP
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j LOG --log-prefix "FORWARD-DROP: " --log-level 4

# Watch the logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/kern.log | grep "FORWARD-DROP"
```

### Creating Service-Specific Rules

```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Allow SSH from Internal to DMZ (insert at beginning)
sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d 192.168.100.0/24 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow DNS queries from Internal to Outside (if needed later)
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d 10.0.10.0/24 -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Exercises

### Exercise A: Create a DMZ Isolation Rule Set

Create rules that:
1. Allow Internal ‚Üí DMZ (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH)
2. Block DMZ ‚Üí Internal (all traffic)
3. Allow DMZ ‚Üí Outside (HTTP, HTTPS for updates)
4. Block Outside ‚Üí DMZ (will be handled in later chapters with DNAT)

```bash
vagrant ssh firewall

# Clear existing FORWARD rules
sudo iptables -F FORWARD
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# Internal to DMZ services
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d 192.168.100.0/24 -p tcp -m multiport --dports 22,80,443 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d 192.168.100.0/24 -p icmp -j ACCEPT

# DMZ to Outside (for updates)
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.100.0/24 -d 10.0.10.0/24 -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -j ACCEPT

# Allow established/related connections back
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Log dropped packets
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -j LOG --log-prefix "FORWARD-DROP: "
```

### Exercise B: Test Your Rules

```bash
# Test Internal to DMZ
vagrant ssh internal-client
curl http://dmz-server              # Should work
ssh vagrant@dmz-server "hostname"   # Should work
ping -c 2 dmz-server               # Should work

# Test DMZ to Internal (should fail)
vagrant ssh dmz-server
ping -c 2 internal-client          # Should fail
```

## üìù Lab Questions

1. **What happens if you put a general ACCEPT rule before specific DROP rules?**

2. **Why do we need both outbound and return traffic rules when not using stateful tracking?**

3. **What's the difference between these two approaches:**
   - Separate rules for each direction
   - Using `--ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED`

4. **How would you temporarily disable all FORWARD filtering for troubleshooting?**

## üéì Key Takeaways

1. **FORWARD chain controls inter-network traffic** through the firewall
2. **Rule order matters** - first match wins
3. **Default policies** should be restrictive (DROP)
4. **Stateful tracking** (`conntrack`) simplifies return traffic handling
5. **Logging** helps troubleshoot blocked connections
6. **Specific rules** should come before general rules

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

In Chapter 3, we'll explore INPUT and OUTPUT chains to protect the firewall itself, and in Chapter 4, we'll add NAT to enable communication with external networks.

**üí° Pro Tip**: Always test your rules incrementally and keep the `iptables -F FORWARD` command handy to clear rules if you lock yourself out!
